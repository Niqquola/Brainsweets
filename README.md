i want to program but i don't know what for, so solving little problems seems good too


## The Havel-Hakimi algorithm
You got a murder, N witnesses and a compiler.
You ask each witness how many people they have met, and you mark the results down in such manner.
  [5, 3, 0, 2, 6, 2, 0, 7, 2, 5]
How do you know if they are telling the truth?  Havel-Hakimi algorithm works wonders.
